## About

I am a postdoctoral fellow at <a href="https://oicr.on.ca/">OICR</a> working with <a href="https://oicr.on.ca/investigators/lincoln-stein/">professor Lincoln Stein</a> in the department of Adaptive Oncology.

I started my PhD working in the field of Natural Language Processing and in about a year after, I moved to the amazing field of Computational Biology, joined <a href="https://github.com/COMBINE-lab">Combine lab</a> and started working under the supervision of <a href="http://www.robpatro.com/redesign/">professor Rob Patro</a>. 
Since then, my main focus has been on designing and implementing time and space efficient data structures plus reference-based and reference-free indexing tools that are used to query, search, align, assemble or compare sequencing read datasets. 
I have also experience in abundance estimation specifically for metagenomic samples.
In combine lab, we made use of different statistical approaches and probabilistic models in addition to succinct data structures and hashing algorithms to optimize our approximate alignments or sequence search on large collections of sequencing or assembled data and have a more statistically accurate interpretation of the estimated results.Â 
I have recently become more and more interested in the application of such tools for better understanding of the sequencing data and novel discoveries via modeling and statistical analysis of such data. That is why I started my postdoc in a cancer research institute and specially with prof. Stein to get closer to the biology of things, specifically sensing the  main computational challenges that arise in the midst of curing cancer!! or looking for the computational improvements that can be made to increase either the accuracy of different cancers' diagnosis and prognosis or the performance of the dedicated pipelines. the computational pipelines.
Before my PhD, I worked in industry on different areas for 5 years, mostly developing data mining and outlier detection applications in database platforms, and web enterprise applications in Java.

Github's Octocat was designed by Simon Oxley, alongside the white bird Twitter used (before they received a proper logo) as part of a usual routine of cranking out images for iStock. GitHub saw it, and wanted it, presumably under the notion that it can represent how complex code combines to create peculiar things, much like the octopuss... except the CEO of GitHub called it an octocat, and it has been the octocat since <a href="https://www.quora.com/GitHub/What-is-the-story-behind-GitHub%E2%80%99s-octocat-mascot" target="_blank">[via]</a>.
