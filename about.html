## About

I'm a third year PhD student in Computer Science at Stony Brook University. I have worked on different areas after completing my undergrad, mostly developing data mining applications in database platforms, and web enterprise applications in Java. I have moved to the amazing field of Computational Biology for about a year now and joined <a href="https://github.com/COMBINE-lab">Combine lab</a> and started working under the supervision of <a href="http://www.robpatro.com/redesign/">professor Rob Patro</a>. Most of my focus now is on designing and implementing time and space efficient data structures plus reference-based and reference-free indexing tools that are used to query, search, align, assemble or compare sequencing read datasets. We make use of different statistical approaches and machine learning methods in addition to succinct data structures and hashing algorithms to optimize our approximate alignments or assembly outputs and have a more statistically accurate interpretation of the estimated results.Â

Github's Octocat was designed by Simon Oxley, alongside the white bird Twitter used (before they received a proper logo) as part of a usual routine of cranking out images for iStock. GitHub saw it, and wanted it, presumably under the notion that it can represent how complex code combines to create peculiar things, much like the octopuss... except the CEO of GitHub called it an octocat, and it has been the octocat since <a href="https://www.quora.com/GitHub/What-is-the-story-behind-GitHub%E2%80%99s-octocat-mascot" target="_blank">[via]</a>.
